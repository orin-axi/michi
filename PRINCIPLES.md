# Principles

Two questions come up over and over: **should this go in michi?** and **how should this work get done?** This doc answers both, so nobody — human or agent — has to re-derive the reasoning from scratch each time. It's the "why" behind `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CLAUDE.md`'s rules, not a replacement for either.

---

## What belongs in michi

A primitive earns a place here only if it clears all five gates below. These are yes/no checks with evidence, not vibes — if you can't point to the evidence, it doesn't clear the gate yet.

### 1. Rendering, not domain logic

It turns already-decided data into agent-readable strings/types. It doesn't decide _what_ data survives.

- One established exception: char/byte-level truncation (`truncate`, `ToonOptions::max_cell_len`) — treated as rendering safety, not business logic.
- **The ceiling:** if a tool's real need is more sophisticated than a generic primitive can serve — a custom ranking algorithm, a heuristic tuned to one tool's data shape — that's a sign the primitive doesn't belong in michi, not a sign to make michi's primitive more complex. See [Split the decision from the signal](#split-the-decision-from-the-signal) for how to resolve this without compromising on either.

### 2. Zero-dep by default, no exceptions

New dependencies are opt-in behind a Cargo feature, never required in the default build.

- If something's _correct_ implementation needs a mandatory dependency, the fix isn't "make an exception" — redesign around caller-supplied injection (a closure, a trait), or it doesn't belong here.

### 3. Genuinely cross-tool — verified, not assumed

Earns inclusion when independent, real tools would otherwise hand-roll the identical pattern.

- "Independent" and "real" are load-bearing. One tool using a pattern heavily is one data point, not proof.
- **What clearing this bar looks like:** a survey across several real agent-facing dev tools (a code-search engine, a CLI proxy, a context-compression tool, a code-graph server) found `help[]`-shaped "note for the agent" hints independently reinvented, inconsistently, in every one of them.
- A pattern seen in only one tool — however heavily repeated inside that tool — isn't there yet. Watch for a second independent confirmation before building it.

### 4. Doesn't duplicate an existing primitive

Check `hints` / `recovery` / `idempotency` / `status` / `error` / `mcp` first. Verify the distinction concretely — don't assume novelty from a vibe.

- "This looks similar to X" means go read X's source, not assume it's covered.
- Example: a proposed "diagnostics" primitive looked adjacent to `idempotency::PartialSuccess` — until actually reading `PartialSuccess`'s doc comment showed it's scoped to multi-step _mutating_ operations, not read-path degradation. They turned out genuinely distinct, but that took checking, not assuming either way.

### 5. Deviations get tracked, not silently absorbed

Where the final shape diverges from the original ask or an earlier draft, it goes in a Design Decisions table. Spec and code should never quietly drift apart.

## Split the decision from the signal

Gate 1's ceiling ("stay generic" vs. "real tools need real sophistication") isn't a tension to compromise on — it's usually an architecture problem. Separate the _domain-specific decision_ from the _universal signal_.

**Worked example: truncation.** Deciding _which_ items survive a budget is tool-specific — personalized-PageRank over a call graph, a statistical outlier-preserving sampler, a simple first-N cutoff. None of that belongs in michi. But _reporting_ what got cut, in a consistent agent-readable shape, is exactly what every tool needs regardless of how it decided:

```rust
/// What survived some truncation/budget decision, however it was made.
pub struct TruncationOutcome<T> {
    pub kept: Vec<T>,
    pub total_before: usize,
    pub truncated: bool,
}

impl<T> TruncationOutcome<T> {
    /// Michi's standard help[]-shaped signal for what got cut — same
    /// contract regardless of which strategy produced this outcome.
    pub fn hint(&self, guidance: impl Into<String>) -> Option<Hint> { /* ... */ }
}

// Zero-dep "best practice" strategies michi ships, for the common case:
pub fn truncate_by_count<T>(items: Vec<T>, max: usize) -> TruncationOutcome<T>;
pub fn truncate_by_bytes<T>(items: Vec<T>, max_bytes: usize, size_of: impl Fn(&T) -> usize) -> TruncationOutcome<T>;
```

A caller with a genuinely novel heuristic never has to fit their algorithm into michi's shape — they wrap whatever they decided in `TruncationOutcome` and get the same hint/report format everyone else gets. Michi owns the contract, not the heuristic.

**When a new primitive seems too domain-specific to generalize, ask whether it splits this way first.** Often only half of it actually is.

## How work gets done

Heuristics, not hard rules — process needs contextual judgment the content checklist doesn't.

### 1. TDD, always

Failing test first, verified red for the right reason, then implementation, then green. No implementation code without a preceding red test.

### 2. Independent verification before "done"

A separate pass re-checks against the spec by running the actual output — not by trusting the implementer's self-report or re-reading the diff.

- Per-task review alone has missed real bugs that a separately-scoped validation pass, checking actual wire output, caught.
- "Every task's reviewer said pass" and "the feature actually works" are different questions. Both need answering.

### 3. Verify before asserting

Claims about external state — a registry's current contents, another project's actual spec, a dependency's real behavior — get checked directly, not recalled from memory or assumed from a plausible-sounding claim.

- Can't quickly re-verify something? Say so rather than asserting confidence.

### 4. History is append-only

Superseded plans/specs get a notice pointing at what replaced them, not a rewrite pretending they always said the current thing.

- A plan document that was correct when written stays as written. Corrections happen in new commits, not retroactive edits to old ones.

### 5. Publish/release gates are earned

Passing a component's own tests isn't "ready to ship."

- A release gate (e.g. crates.io publish conditioned on a real consumer integration, not just internal completeness) exists for a reason.
- Treat it as binding until the condition it names is actually met — not as a formality to route around once everything else looks finished.

## Using this document

- **Content questions** ("should X be a michi primitive?") → the five gates above, in order. Stop at the first "no."
- **Process questions** ("is this ready to ship / merge / call done?") → the five heuristics, weighed together, not mechanically checked off.
- **When they pull in different directions** — a genuinely useful pattern seen only once, a process shortcut that would ship something faster — that's not a bug in the framework. It's the signal to slow down and think it through explicitly, rather than pick the convenient answer.
