# Overview & Setup

michi is a Rust crate of pure agentic response primitives — the formatting and signaling conventions that make tools ergonomic for LLM agents, regardless of protocol or language.

## What it is

AXI (Agent eXperience Interface) is a set of ten design principles for agent-ergonomic tooling that treats token budget as a first-class constraint.

- **Core claim:** "MCP vs. CLI" is the wrong frame — the real question is which design principles make _any_ interface effective for an LLM agent.
- A well-designed interface following these principles measurably beats both naive CLIs and MCP on task success rate, cost, duration, and turn count.

michi encodes the subset of AXI that's pure, language-agnostic computation — the parts worth one canonical, tested implementation instead of ad hoc re-derivation in every tool.

**Seven of the ten principles, as typed Rust:**

| Principle                           | Module(s)                                             |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| P1 — Token-Efficient Output         | `toon`, `kv`                                          |
| P3 — Content Truncation             | `truncate`                                            |
| P4 — Pre-Computed Aggregates        | `ToonOptions::total_count`, `status` health summaries |
| P5 — Definitive Empty States        | `empty`                                               |
| P6 — Structured Errors & Exit Codes | `error`, `idempotency`                                |
| P8 — Content First                  | `status`                                              |
| P9 — Contextual Disclosure          | `hints`, `recovery`                                   |

The other three stay out of scope on purpose.

- **P2 (Minimal Default Schemas)** is supported — callers pass exactly the fields they want — but not enforced.
- **P7 (Ambient Context)** and **P10 (Consistent Help)** are session-hook and CLI-framework concerns; they belong in the consuming tool, not a rendering crate.

No protocol knowledge, no async runtime. Pure computation: data in, strings and types out.

- Rust consumers take a direct crates.io or git dependency.
- TypeScript consumers reach it through the `@orin-axi/michi` npm package.

## Why this exists

AXI's principles usually get implemented ad hoc, scattered across tools instead of shared:

- Scattered TypeScript conventions in MCP servers
- Implicit CLI patterns
- Per-tool string formatting that drifts over time

With michi:

- TOON has one canonical, tested implementation shared by every consumer
- `help[]` hints, `totalCount` formatting, truncation signals, and recovery shapes are defined once and can't drift between tools
- Any agent-facing Rust CLI imports the primitives directly
- Any TypeScript MCP server or CLI reaches them through the npm package

Non-agentic tools — build scripts, infrastructure CLIs — never touch michi. The package boundary keeps agentic concepts out of code that doesn't need them.

## What's out of scope, deliberately

- **Display-format Markdown.** michi is the `audience: ["assistant"]` compact surface. Display rendering for `audience: ["user"]` stays in your MCP SDK or application layer.
- **Full MCP protocol knowledge.** No JSON-RPC, no tool registration, no server bootstrapping, no `outputSchema` validation. `AgentResponse::to_call_tool_result()` assembles the `content[]`/`isError`/`structuredContent` shape from an already-built response — see [04-mcp-and-napi.md](04-mcp-and-napi.md) — but nothing beyond that one assembly step.
- **CLI framework.** No argument parsing, no stdin/stdout handling.
- **HTTP client.** No auth, no request construction — just retry-delay primitives you plug into your own client.
- **Async runtime.** Zero tokio, zero async-std. Every function is sync and pure; you own the retry loop.
- **Full retry implementation.** michi gives you `RetryConfig`, `parse_retry_after()`, `next_retry_delay()`. The sleep-and-re-execute loop is yours.
- **Caching.** Use `moka` or equivalent.
- **Logging / telemetry.** Use `tracing` independently.
- **Schema validation.** Your concern, your type system.
- **MCP server bootstrapping.** `server.tool()`, tool discovery, deferred loading — stays in your SDK.

## Who consumes this, and how

```
Any Rust CLI binary
  Cargo.toml dep on michi (crates.io or git)
  Render --format toon via michi::render_toon()
  Full access to every module — no NAPI overhead

Any TypeScript CLI
  npm dep on @orin-axi/michi
  --format toon dispatch calls into the NAPI wrapper
  Same output; the NAPI boundary is transparent
  render_for()/renderFor() picks agent vs. human output

Any TypeScript MCP server
  npm dep on @orin-axi/michi
  Renders TOON for the audience:["assistant"] content block
  Assembles MCP content[] from the returned string
```

## Cargo.toml

`michi` is a Cargo **workspace**, not a single crate — split from an original monolithic crate on 2026-08-04 into purpose-built sub-crates (see [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full component table and the rationale). The root `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[workspace]
members  = [
  ".",
  "crates/michi-truncate",
  "crates/michi-resilience",
  "crates/michi-toon",
  "crates/michi-core",
  "packages/michi-node",
]

[workspace.dependencies]
thiserror   = "2"
compact_str = "0.8"
serde       = { version = "1.0.228", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json  = { version = "1.0.150", features = ["preserve_order"] }
schemars    = "0.8"
miette      = "7"

[package]
name = "michi"
version = "0.1.0"

[features]
default  = []
napi     = ["dep:napi", "dep:napi-derive", "dep:serde_json", "michi-core/serde"]
serde    = ["michi-core/serde", "michi-toon/serde"]
schemars = ["michi-core/schemars", "michi-toon/schemars"]
miette   = ["michi-core/miette"]

[dependencies]
michi-truncate   = { path = "crates/michi-truncate", version = "0.1.0" }
michi-resilience = { path = "crates/michi-resilience", version = "0.1.0" }
michi-toon       = { path = "crates/michi-toon", version = "0.1.0" }
michi-core       = { path = "crates/michi-core", version = "0.1.0" }
napi        = { version = "3", features = ["napi6", "serde-json"], optional = true }
napi-derive = { version = "3", optional = true }
serde_json  = { workspace = true, optional = true }
```

(Elided: `[profile.release]`/`[profile.bench]`, `[dev-dependencies]`, `[[bench]]` entries — see the real file for those.)

Default features add zero runtime dependencies beyond the four workspace sub-crates, each of which is itself zero-dep by default.

- `serde_json` only enters the root crate's tree through `napi` (typed `structuredContent`, wire-conformant MCP types) or the `serde` feature chain — never both unconditionally, never with neither enabled. (`michi-toon` unconditionally enables `compact_str`'s own `serde` Cargo feature regardless of michi's `serde` feature, so `serde` the _crate_ is transitively present in the default dependency graph even though no default-feature type derives `Serialize`/`Deserialize` — see `crates/michi-toon/Cargo.toml`.)
- `kv::KvValue` fills the role `serde_json::Value` would have for every consumer who doesn't opt in, at zero dependency cost.
- `preserve_order` keeps `toon::list()`'s field order matching each struct's declared order instead of alphabetizing it.
- `schemars` derives `JsonSchema` on DTO types; `miette` implements `miette::Diagnostic` for `DomainError`. Neither existed at the time this doc was first written — both are now real, shipped features.

`pipeline`/`fuzzy`/`cache`/`cli` **execution** is not a Cargo feature of this crate at all, and never will be.

- That async execution layer (Plan 2) lands as genuinely separate crates when it's actually built, never as features gated on michi's own `Cargo.toml`.
- `pipeline`'s pure **data model** (`Pipeline`, `PipelineStep`, `StepStatus`, `.render()`) already exists today in `michi-core` — unconditionally compiled, no feature gate. Only orchestration/execution is deferred to Plan 2. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) for the crate-boundary layout and [06-decisions.md](06-decisions.md) for the decision rule behind the split.
- `serde` isn't part of that Plan 2 set, despite historically sitting next to it in the feature table — it gates `Serialize`/`Deserialize` on Plan 1's own types.

`napi-build` lives in `packages/michi-node/Cargo.toml`, not here — that's the cdylib crate the actual napi-rs build step compiles.
