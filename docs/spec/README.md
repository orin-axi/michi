# michi spec

The technical reference for the `michi` crate — what it does, how it's shaped, and why.

## Reading order

| Doc | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| [01-overview-and-setup.md](01-overview-and-setup.md) | What michi is, why it exists, what's deliberately out of scope, who consumes it, `Cargo.toml`, crate layout |
| [02-toon-format.md](02-toon-format.md) | The TOON grammar — the agent-facing list format |
| [03-rust-api.md](03-rust-api.md) | Every module: `toon`, `kv`, `hints`, `truncate`, `empty`, `error`, `idempotency`, `resilience`, `status`, `recovery`, `response` |
| [04-mcp-and-napi.md](04-mcp-and-napi.md) | The `mcp` module, the NAPI/npm boundary, and the builder-across-FFI problem |
| [05-scope-and-quality.md](05-scope-and-quality.md) | What's formalized vs. what stays in your app, feature flags, versioning, performance, testing |
| [06-decisions.md](06-decisions.md) | Open questions and the reasoning behind everything that isn't obvious from the code |

New to the crate? Read 01 → 02 → 03 in order — that's the whole mental model. 04–06 are reference, read as needed.

## Known gaps

**TOON vs. Markdown-KV retrieval accuracy hasn't been measured.**

- The token-count win is real.
- Whether it holds up on retrieval accuracy across model sizes is untested.
- See [06-decisions.md](06-decisions.md).

**No real consumer depends on michi yet.** crates.io publish is explicitly gated on that happening first — see [05-scope-and-quality.md](05-scope-and-quality.md) for current status.

**`cli` isn't a Cargo feature of this crate at all.** Reserved name for future terminal-aware rendering, in a separate crate, not implemented.

**Plan 2 (the async execution layer) doesn't exist as code in this crate — but `pipeline`'s half has landed as its own crate.**

- `pipeline` has a real, tested data type and `render()` in `michi-core` — always compiled.
- The actual executor now exists too, just not in this crate: `crates/michi-pipeline` ships `execute_pipeline`/`execute_pipeline_parallel`, `CircuitBreaker`, and `CancellationToken`. It depends on `michi-core` (for the `Pipeline` data type) and `michi-resilience` (for retry config) directly — not on the root `michi` facade, and isn't re-exported through it.
- `fuzzy`, `cache`, and `cli` don't exist anywhere in the workspace at all — not even as stubs. Earlier placeholder stub files were deliberately deleted; see [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../ARCHITECTURE.md).
- Each remaining piece lands as its own crate when it's actually built, per the same pattern `michi-pipeline` followed.
- This spec covers Plan 1, the pure-primitives crate, only — `michi-pipeline`'s own API is documented in its own crate, not here.
